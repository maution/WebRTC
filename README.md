# WebRTC
This is a personal project to develop a WebRTC APP in which I hope to learn couple things.

Most of the theory used in this project comes from this book (https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/real-time-communication-with/9781449371869) and my experience as VoIP engineer. 

Learnings from Sun 8 May 
- Many methods got deprecated from the demo on the book
- Can add a framework to make it look better from start, I choosed bootstrap since I like it and it is easy to use.
